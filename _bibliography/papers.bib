abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for classifying the feline sex based on the respective vocalizations. Due to the size of the available dataset, we rely on tree-based classifiers which can efficiently learn classification rules in such poor data availability cases. More specifically, this work investigates the ability of random forests and boosting classifiers when trained with a wide range of acoustic features derived both from time and frequency domain. The considered classifiers are evaluated using standardized figures of merit including f1-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The best-performing classifier was the CatBoost, while the obtained results are in line with the state-of-the-art accuracy levels in the field of animal sex classification.},

  abstract = {Analysing harvested seeds is a time-consuming task in the seed-producing industry. Automating this process has the potential to enhance and expedite agricultural seed production. In our study, we focus on differentiating Canola seeds from visually similar non-Canola seeds using computer vision techniques. Our approach utilises both RGB and hyperspectral images, captured by a specialised camera, to train separate autoencoder neural networks. By leveraging the high spatial resolution of RGB data and the high spectral resolution of hyperspectral data, we develop distinct models for Canola seed analysis, ensuring a comprehensive and robust assessment. The autoencoder networks are trained on a dataset of Canola seeds, allowing for the extraction of latent representations from both RGB and hyperspectral data. This enables efficient compression of input data and effective discrimination between Canola and non-Canola seeds. Our proposed approach demonstrates promising results in detecting non-Canola seeds in unseen test data.}

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging offers manifold opportunities for applications that may not, or only partially, be achieved within the visual spectrum. Our paper presents a novel approach for Single-Label Hyperspectral Image Classification, demonstrated through the example of a key challenge faced by agricultural seed producers: seed purity testing. We employ Self-Supervised Learning and Masked Image Modeling techniques to tackle this task. Recognizing the challenges and costs associated with acquiring hyperspectral data, we aim to develop a versatile method capable of working with visible, arbitrary combinations of spectral bands (multispectral data) and hyperspectral sensor data. By integrating RGB and hyperspectral data, we leverage the detailed spatial information from RGB images and the rich spectral information from hyperspectral data to enhance the accuracy of seed classification. Through evaluations in various real-life scenarios, we demonstrate the flexibility, scalability, and efficiency of our approach.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks have become an important tool for various Computer Vision tasks. Yet, increasing complexity of such architectures drives computational costs. To this end, we propose two measures to achieve similar classification results as state-of-the-art architectures while at the same time reducing model complexity significantly. Firstly, we describe a novel type of non-linear parameter-efficient morphological layers inspired by concepts that are well-known and widely used with convolutions. Secondly, we present a set of simple network architectures, organized as optimization framework, which is enhanced by neural architecture search and hyperparameter optimization. In experiments with hyperspectral remote sensing data, we demonstrate that the identified optimal morphological architecture produces results not only comparable with other architectures from the optimization framework, but also comparable or better than selected state-of-the-art neural network architectures for image classification. Depending on the performed task, the proposed optimized architecture requires up to 25 times fewer parameters than actual state-of-the-art networks.}

  abstract = {The purity analysis of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is currently a labor-intensive and manual process, requiring significant human effort for accurate assessment. In this context, the KIRa-Sorter system presents an innovative solution that leverages hyperspectral imaging technology for automating the comprehensive classification of various contaminants present in rapeseed samples. The initial phase of the KIRa-Sorter system involves the efficient capture of hyperspectral and RGB image data from rapeseed samples as input for classification. From up to 200 different types of foreign objects typically found in these samples, a reduced coreset has been defined that the system is able to automatically singulate, classify and physically sort.}
