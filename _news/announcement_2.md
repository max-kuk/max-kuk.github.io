I am pleased to share that I have just joined <a href='https://uob-mavi.github.io/people/'>MaVi Research Group</a> at the <a href='https://www.bristol.ac.uk'>University of Bristol</a> for the next three months. During this time, I will be working on a project focused on behavioural animal analysis. Looking forward to the experience and the opportunity to contribute to the research.
