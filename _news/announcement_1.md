Our paper "BiCAE - A Bimodal Convolutional Autoencoder for Seed Purity Testing" has been accepted to ECML-PKDD 2024 in Vilnius, Lithuania. The paper is a collaboration with the Machine Learning Group at the Neuromorphic Information Processing Department of Leipzig University. The paper presents a novel approach to seed purity testing using hyperspectral and RGB images.
