Salut! I'm Maksim Kukushkin. I am pursuing my PhD at the <a href="https://nmi.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/"> Neuromorphic Information Processing Department</a> of Leipzig University. Additionally, I work as a Research Associate in the Digital Research Methods in Medicine Group at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. My current research focuses on analysing hyperspectral, video, and medical data, as well as developing classification algorithms for these data types.
