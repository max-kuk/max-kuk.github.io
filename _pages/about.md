Salut! I'm Maksim Kukushkin. I am pursuing my PhD in the Machine Learning Group at the Neuromorphic Information Processing Department of Leipzig University. Additionally, I work as a Research Assistant in the Digital Research Methods in Medicine Group at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. My current research focuses on analysing hyperspectral, video, and medical data, as well as developing classification algorithms for these data types.
