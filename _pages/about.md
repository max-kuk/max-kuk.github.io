Salut! I'm Maksim Kukushkin. I am pursuing my PhD in the <a href="https://nmi.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/"> Neuromorphic Information Processing Department</a> at Leipzig University. Additionally, I work as a Research Associate in the Digital Research Methods in Medicine Group at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. My PhD is supervised by 

<a href="https://www.umh.de/forschung/nachwuchsgruppen/nwg-schmid">Jun.-Prof. Dr. Thomas Schmid</a> and <a href="https://nmi.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/staff/prof-dr-martin-bogdan/">Prof. Dr. Martin Bogdan</a>

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and medical image analysis. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms for the analysis of multi-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral images and videos, with a focus on classification tasks. My work involves exploring novel approaches to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these algorithms in real-world applications.
